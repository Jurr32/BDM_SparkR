It is advised to use Scala 2.10.4, at least I used this, if it works with your current scala version, it is ok.

My program arguments: input ionosphere.data k 7 20 13 5 output.txt 0.0 ml

Note that I hardcoded number of features value and class value position, so if you do it with different dataset, please change them.

Program output is in the folder output.txt (yes, it is a folder name).
